All you need is an account for Ironbane.\r\n\r\nWhen you add a contribution, you earn **reputation** (rep), which will be visible on your profile and on the forum. A higher rep allows you to get more privileges, such as becoming a moderator or game master, GitHub access, the ability to give others reputation for their work and more. We want to reward people for their work.\r\n\r\n##How much rep do I get for a contribution?\r\nThis will depends on the quality of work you provide, but here are some generic guidelines:\r\n###Generic reputation award table\r\n\r\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" class=\"forumcontainer\">\r\n            <thead>\r\n             <tr>\r\n                <th>Action</th>\r\n                <th>Reward</th>\r\n            </tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n            <tr>\r\n                <td class=\"row1\">Forum post</td>\r\n                <td class=\"row1\">1 rep</td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n                <td class=\"row2\">Bug report</td>\r\n                <td class=\"row2\">5 rep</td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n             <tr>\r\n                <td class=\"row1\">Contributed content (art/music/model)</td>\r\n                <td class=\"row1\">10 rep (+ Bonus depending on quality)</td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n                <td class=\"row2\">Accepted pull request</td>\r\n                <td class=\"row2\">20 rep (+ Bonus depending on quality)</td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n        </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n## What can I work on?\r\nIf you were to join, what would you love to work on? Skill is important, but more important is your love for the skill. It doesn\'t matter if you suck, the only thing that is important is motivation. You must be willing to learn from others.\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"centered\">[I want to code\\!](/article/get-involved-code)</h2>\r\n<p class=\"centered\">\r\n![coding](/images/uploads/public/code.png)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"centered\">[I want to create 3D models\\!](/article/get-involved-models)</h2>\r\n<p class=\"centered\">\r\n![coding](/images/uploads/public/models.png)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"centered\"> [I want to make art\\!](/article/get-involved-art)</h2>\r\n<p class=\"centered\">\r\n![coding](/images/uploads/public/art.png)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nLooking for something else?

Javascript is arguably an easy language to work with, and it allows you to program more productively with easy debugging and no need to recompile (atleast on the client).\r\n\r\nWhat am I allowed to work on?\r\n\r\nAnything you like! You can work on the game code, the 3D renderer, boss scripts, forum software or even on this page you\'re reading right now! You must work on whatever you want to work on, to keep yourself motivated. You basically have the power to change anything you like.\r\n\r\nAll the source code is waiting for you on GitHub. With that said, you need to learn how to use Git if you haven\'t yet. It\'s an incredible powerful tool and you will need it at some point in your life anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat\'s Git? I\'m scared!\r\n\r\nNo need to be. Read this tutorial, it explains Git well and will get you up and running in no time.\r\n\r\nHow do I contribute?\r\n\r\nBy making pull requests on the repository you\'re working on! It\'s that simple. Make a pull request and one of the lead developers will check it out and give you feedback. If the code looks fine, it will be pushed live to Ironbane.com instantly.\r\n\r\nStart by reading the Getting started pages on the GitHub repository.

We use this information to verify that the user is not attempting to gain an unfair advantage by registering multiple accounts automatically in his/her name. It is optional for the user to provide his/her real name. We use this information for statistical purposes only.

This profile is used to tailor a user\"s visit to our website. We do not share your profile with other third parties.\r\n\r\nCookies\r\nA cookie is a piece of data stored on the user\'s computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user\'s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. These cookies will only be stored on your computer if you wish that Ironbane.com remember your login data.\r\n\r\nBy setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site, however, their ability to experience the site will be severely limited because cookies are an integral part of our site’s authentication system. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.\r\n\r\nThird Party Cookies\r\nIn the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique \"cookie\" on your browser. \r\n\r\nThis privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Ironbane only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.\r\n\r\nLog Files\r\nLike most standard website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user\'s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable our Web-based service. We use an analysis utility called AWStats that uses log files to analyze traffic and user movement.\r\nCommunications from the Site\r\n\r\nAccount Activation\r\nWe send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username, and that the e-mail address they have provided is in fact a valid e-mail address.\r\n\r\nService Announcements\r\nOn rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. We reserve the right to send an e-mail to our users if, for instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.\r\n\r\nCustomer Service\r\nWe communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email, in accordance with the users wishes.\r\nSharing\r\n\r\nLegal Disclaimer\r\nThough we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.\r\n\r\nLinks\r\nThis website contains links to other sites.

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.\r\n\r\nSurveys\r\nFrom time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Anonymous survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users\' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice.\r\n\r\nChat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums\r\nPlease keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\nThis website takes every precaution to protect our users\' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.\r\n\r\nCorrecting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information\r\nIf a user\'s personally identifiable information changes, or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. This can usually be done by emailing our Customer Support.\r\n\r\nNotification of Changes\r\nIf we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
